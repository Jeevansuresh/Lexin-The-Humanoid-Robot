This is a humanoid robot that I built with Nodemcu ESP8266-12E and Raspberry Pi Programmed in Arduino IDE and Python, which aims to perceive or infer information, and respond to the Human Conversation accordingly with pre-written scripts and web scraping information from the Internet,it also has the ability to move with Commands in 8 Directions and can be controlled via Remote as well (Mobile Phone)

This robot can answer your questions by pre-written script or by the information on google

It is connected with an open source IoT Server called Blynk and hence can be controlled from any part of the world with Internet with the Blynk App

The Robot works with the voice assistant service from an Python Script along with an open source computational Intelligence called Wolfram Alpha and scrapping Information from Wikipedia

In the coming future, I will be working on to add more features like Face Detection and Recognition, Object Detection, Servo Hand Movements Etc

For the Instructions about the prograrmming and circuit, refer to "Lexin instructions.txt"
