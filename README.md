This is a humanoid robot that I built with Python and Raspberry Pi, which aims to perceive or infer information, and respond to the Human Conversation accordingly with pre-written scripts and web scraping information from the Internet, it also has the ability to move with Commands in 8 Directions 


It is connected with an open source IoT Server called Blynk and hence can be controlled from any part of the world with Internet 

The Robot works with the voice assistant service from an Python Script along with an open source computational Intelligence called Wolfram Alpha and scrapping Information from Wikipedia 

In the coming future, I will be working on to add more features like Face Detection and Recognition, Object Detection, Servo Hand Movements Etc
